# Kodekloud's Terraform Challenge

This series consists of a set of challenges that will assist you in mastering provisioning and managing infrastructure using Terraform.

For these challenges, you will start off with deploying a simple webapp on an existing Kubernetes cluster and then move on to more complicated challenges involving provisioning resources and entire infrastructure stacks in the AWS cloud.

## [Challenge 1](./lab1/)

In this challenge we will deploy several Kubernetes resources using terraform.

## [Challenge 2](./lab2/)

In this challenge we will implement a simple LAMP stack using terraform and docker.

## [Challenge 3](./lab3/)

In this challenge we will implement a simple EC2 instance with some preinstalled packages.
